Python scripts for network installing CIA/TIK files with FBI. Everything should
work in both Python 2 and 3. You can use the "-h" argument with any of these
scripts to get information about the command line parameters.

net_installer.pyw:
    This script implements the FBI 2.4.5 TCP/HTTP and FBI 2.1.0 QR/HTTP network
    install protocols. The PyQRCode module is required if you want to use the
    QR code installer, which can be installed with this command:
        pip install --user pyqrcode
    You can drag-and-drop a CIA/TIK file or a folder containing CIA/TIK files
    onto the script to display the QR code. To install without a QR code you
    will need to use the "--send" argument from the command line.

sockfile.py:
    This script implements the FBI 2.x TCP network install protocol. It can be
    used to install multiple CIA/TIK files over the network. Support for TIK
    installation was added in FBI 2.1.0. In FBI 2.4.3 this protocol was
    removed.

sockfile_old.py:
    This script implements the FBI 1.x TCP network install protocol. It can be
    used to installing a single CIA file over the network. In FBI 2.0.0 this
    protocol was removed.

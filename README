Python scripts for network installing CIA files with FBI.
Works with Python 2 and 3.

sockfile.py:
    Command line only. Works just like the official Java sockfile. You can use
    the "-h" option to get help on the command line parameters.

qr_installer.pyw:
    This requires the "pyqrcode" module to be installed, which you can install
    by opening the console/terminal and typing:
        pip install --user pyqrcode
    In Windows you can drag-and-drop a CIA file onto the script to display the
    QR code. On Linux or Mac you can also display the QR code in the terminal by
    using the "-t" argument. You can use the "-h" argument to get help on the
    command line parameters.
